<h1>System</h1>

<h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>
        C++ System is a header and Windows only library for interacting with the machine, in the way that C# does, but since C++ is not run off a Virtual Machine, we often find ourselves writing more code than necessary (many times more than once). So with this library, my goal is to reduce this dramatically when working on Windows (my primary goal). 
    </p>

<h2>Who is this for?</h2>
    <p>
        Me. No really, this library is made solely for me, and no one else. I'm a primary C# developer, and this library helps me find comfort when working in C++. After-all, the language you're using should feel like home, right? So why not do your best to make it feel as such. 
    </p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
    <p> 
        I'm unlikely to accept PRs or add your issues to this library, unless you're fixing an actual bug in the program, there's no need to attempt to contribute :)
